This is a general repository for test.

I won't add anything useful in here, if not my stupid tests.
I think.
Maybe.
Dunno.

Well, I just added something revolutionary: a 14-line decorator to quickly test
pycairo code. You're welcome, world. A very smart, innovative and elaborated
demo is present in pycairo_helloworld.py.
Well, I plan to include some features to allow simple animations (decorator
parameters are already present! But not used, yet), based on time or something.
